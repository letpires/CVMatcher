CVMatcher is an intelligent platform that generates personalized resumes tailored to specific job postings. By leveraging **AI** and **decentralized technologies**, it ensures data security, autonomy, and permanence, empowering users to take control of their professional journey.

## ‚ùì The Problem

- **Generic resumes don‚Äôt work anymore**:  
  Every job has its own requirements, but tailoring a resume for each one can be time-consuming and overwhelming.

- **Unequal access to recruitment technology**:  
  Companies use AI to filter candidates, but job seekers often lack similar tools to optimize their applications.

- **Difficulty tracking multiple job applications**:  
  Managing different versions of resumes and tracking applications can be chaotic.

- **Centralization risks**:  
  Platforms like Orkut and MSN disappeared, taking user data with them. Centralized platforms can vanish, leaving users without access to their professional history.


## üí° The Solution

CVMatcher addresses these challenges by combining **AI** and **blockchain** to create **smart, personalized, and permanent resumes**:

- **AI-Powered Resume Customization**:
  - Analyzes job descriptions.
  - Matches them with your resume.
  - Generates tailored versions.
  - Recommends improvements (e.g., courses, keywords, projects).
  - Highlights less prominent skills.
  - Tracks multiple job applications with ease.

- **Decentralized Data Ownership**:
  - Your data is yours ‚Äî forever.
  - Stored via **IPFS + Blockchain**.
  - Immutable version history.
  - **NFT** as a professional identity.

- A description of the job they‚Äôre applying for.
- An AI agent analyzes the resume and the job posting.
- Generates a customized version of the resume tailored to the role (highlighting keywords, most relevant experiences, etc.).
- Suggests improvements and/or missing fields (e.g., recommended courses, missing keywords).
